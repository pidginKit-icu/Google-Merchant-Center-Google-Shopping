# Google-Merchant-Center-Google-Shopping Readme File
# what
Development kits associated with Google Merchant Center for Google Shopping listings.
# when
Created on December 26th, 2019 (somewhat ironically - at the end of the shopping hustle and bustle of Christmas holidays.
# why
I figure that the learning curve on these things, coming from a novice-to slight-intermediate scale of user-basis: is pretty high. Many auteurs and amateurs of development basis, whether it be on Android, iOS, iPadOS, macOS, Chromium, Windows, etc., are sticking with the self-taught program, and digging through web-site documentation bitsies and burning the midnight oil (myself as one of them).
# where
Google Merchant Center is the avenue (at this point in time, available only in certain countries) through which the Google Shopping Content APIs and listings work.  Here, I'm trying to develop 'on the cheap,' and open-sourced, such as to elicit free user-basis (me, as the user of the Google Small Business, Google MyBusiness, Made With Google, Google AIY, and other various content, software and hardware product, and development kit libraries that Google offers [with various pay scales and dues for the developer (me).]
# how
Ostensibly, the development kits, associated lists, blog posts, and other content included on this site ought form, for the public surveyor's tastes (hopefully, I might add), would amount to a [somewhat elegant and relevant, hopefully] oversight in to the development project, at the scale of perspective, and insight in to what constitutes a Google Shopping listing slight enterprise; with Google GSuite Enterprise, it's currently price-based at $25 USD per month, built on a Google Domains custom-named (gTLD) website, the first of which I decided and happened upon was iPigeon.institute. Through simple rote work and through taking down various people's input of dictation, I'd developed a sense for public relations of the .institute blogging and somewhat academic purveyance of such cause, be it the name that suggestibly so delineates the formative purpose of the development process, whcih the user sees on the front end; intelligentsia going in, hard work going through it, and here and there, we can have some fun and strut a proud pigeon's aptitude in the civic center and surrounding areas of our metropolises and cosmopolitan societies of the world, some day, localized down to all interested and adaptive societies that would take on an iBeaconPidginKit.futbol tech and lifestyle entity, coming to the foray in the wake of the new 3rd millenium A.D.
# who? 
As that I'm the transcriptionist, as well as the developing hands and mind, body and labor behind the iPigeon.institute enterprise, I'd quite obviously appear to be overburdened, at times. My name is Jay Ammon. I'm composing this Readme documentation under the <_< surmise <_< of that I'm not quite alone in this, even though my body and my labors are the vessel by which these things procure development and documentation.

# I suppose; a quick lesson on development documentation is good and in order: please do - document. The rhythms of the documentation going out in to press are significant traits of a good and ethical practice. 
As I was brought up a musician, it is sound, and the characteristics of sound, as well as the various methods in development through which sounds are produced - the typing of the keyboard at the formative old desktop clavier hardware keyboard, paired with the mouse. There are the notification bings and beeps (or sound effects) of the mobile devices we use. Some of these sounds had become iconic reminders of some deeply-held spot in our minds, in relation to our tech and lifestyle lives that we live, yet given some mind to that we, as humans, are not machines, but as that, the lines between contrived and finery grow ever slightly enraveled unto and within one another, and aesthetics become systematics-practicum of some form of learned-machine codex. 

In essence, the true engineer-developer-artist-scientist-laborer, etc., could be - of all things, playing many different roles in development, and such that others ought to follow in similar paths, with good formative documentation to boot.  Here, I prattle on, in somewhat a long-winded form, being that my background is in the humanities, and many (okay, some...) of my colleagues lean heavily in to the social sciences, as well. It's a brink of a nominal phenom, for wordplay's sake - a phenomenal year of intrinsic numerological occurences, this being nearly 2020 A.D., coming very soon.  These things ought be documented and "banged out" with the greatest of ease, the highest of skill, the most eager of wont of learning minds, that there could aught be out there, for the sake of good documentation. No cutting slick corners in the readme and documentation files.

# This being said, as well as many other things in concurrent relevancy, this sort of thing ought do well, going in to the documentation of the development process, delineating the story of how development happens, in the scope, therein, in considering a project-work (gig-job) basis, given that we, as enterprise developers of the entirety of the organizations' entity that's been created - hopefully it's a lasting context that pulls out, on it's own, over the years, and need not be abandoned, or re-fashioned in spite of the loss of the impetus that the idea once had.  Documentation of these phenomena are important for the workflow development process, as well as for the human psyche and to fend off arrhythmias of irregularity. Constantly building relevancy through repetition, rote, and scope, of parameters that could be delineated of yet another science.

Here, I'm aiming at natural language formative assay facets of self-3rd-person reconstrue, that my dialogue dictaphone deliniation of the textual context creates - a somewhat compelling literary form of a marketing basis public relations guide. 

As a musician, as well, the contexts of aesthetic form in linguistic parlance also comes in to play. Resonance, and formant, as well.

Aside from that, I feel that many people, of this generation, had chosen to take on disingenuous personae, for the sake of making fake news articles. I, for one, would strongly place my projections for the coming election on Donald Trump, once again, being elected as President of the United States of America.  Here, in Los Angeles, California, we have so much of what the world has to offer, and I've been highly productive, under the most stringent of welfare pay cycles, of the most menial means.

I talk about this sort of thing on my blogs. 

I'll cut out, at that. Thanks for checking out my software developments. Hardware... soon to come, in coming years.
